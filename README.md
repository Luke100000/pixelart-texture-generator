# Pixelart Texture Generator

Generate pixelart textures from text prompts using [SDXL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952) and
a [pixelart LoRA](https://civitai.com/models/120096/pixel-art-xl).

Provides tools for pixelating, background removal, color palettes, seamless tiling, and more.

Uses the [AI Horde](https://horde.koboldai.net/) to generate the textures.

Employ textures generated by this app responsibly for prototyping, references, and other creative endeavors; refrain
from presenting them as solely your own work.
